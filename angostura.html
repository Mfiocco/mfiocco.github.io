                            <p>The challenge for this logo redesign was to blend the history and prestige of the company
                                with a modernized twistâ€”to create a mark that would be timeless, simple and
                                recognizable.

                            <p>Through the creative process I was able to design a logo that incorporated all the
                                necessary themes in order to produce a timeless, yet modernized redesign sprinkled with
                                cultural significance that elevates the company's brand.

                            <p>In my research, I was able understand the vivid history of Angostura Bitters and how it
                                came to be. Following the rich timeline, from its creation as a medicinal tincture, to a
                                family run and operated business, there were many important connections to be made.
                                While learning about the company and the product, I also looked into cultural clues from
                                both Trinidad and Tobago, as well as cocktail culture to help tell the bigger story.

                                Taking my research and narrowing down important themes to explore was key to guiding my
                                sketching. From there, I went down many paths that could express these themes until I
                                settled on three concepts that were strong enough to move forward with.

                                experimented with different logo styles and explored various directions that could
                                express
                                these themes until I settled on three concepts that were strong enough to move forward

                    <p>The concept of royalty came from Angostura being the only bitters company to be royally
                        appointed. Queen Elizabeth II credited the company as the royal family's official aromatic
                        bitters producer. This gave Angostura a sense of presitge and high regard.</p>

                    <p>For a modern concept, I wanted to keep the design minimal. As a permanent staple in the food and
                        cocktail industry, the "A" structurally signifies a strong foundation and durability to last,
                        much like the company itself.</p>

                    <p>In Trinidad & Tobago there is a large national pride around Angostura. From cultural cuisines
                        prepared with the bitters, to medicinal uses, the Trinidadian people are very proud. By
                        incorporating the national bird, the Scarlet Ibis, the new logo was able to pay homage to the
                        culture of Trinidad & Tobago.</p>
